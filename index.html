            <p>I started my journey as a special education professional because of my strong desire to make education enjoyable and accessible for all students. Throughout my time as an educator, I developed a strong sense of empathy working with students with disabilities and their families. 
               I have always enjoyed finding creative solutions to solve problems. Finding UX design was the perfect blend of the two by being able to design products that enhance user interaction by eliminating pain points. I aspire to use my prior experience as an educator to bring empathy, communication, and design to make enjoyable and accessible user experiences that will ultimately add value to companies.
